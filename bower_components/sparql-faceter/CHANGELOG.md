  SPARQL endpoint.

## [1.3.0] - 2016-11-15

### Changed
- secoJenaTextFacet allows for more user control in the search.
  I.e. it does not modify the user input except for excaping quotes
  (and removing them if they are unbalanced)
- secoJenaTextFacet default priority is now 0 (instead of 10).

## [1.2.1] - 2016-11-15

### Added
- `limit` and `graph` configuration options for secoJenaTextFacet.

## [1.2.0] - 2016-11-14

### Added
- [secoJenaTextFacet](http://semanticcomputing.github.io/angular-semantic-faceted-search/#/api/seco.facetedSearch.directive:secoJenaTextFacet)
- `priority` configuration variable to provide a way to sort the facet constraints (see the [documentation][api]).

  and in the date picker, regardless of the user's timezone.

## [1.1.0] - 2016-11-03

### Changed
- Timespan facet now works as an actual facet by querying for minimum and maximum
  available dates, and adjusts the datepicker max and min dates accordingly.

### Fixed
- Fix setting the timespan face's initial values.
- Fix an issue with the timespan facet where the selected date could be different
  from the one actually used in the query.
